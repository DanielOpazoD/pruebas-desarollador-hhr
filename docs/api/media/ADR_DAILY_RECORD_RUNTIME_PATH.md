# ADR: Daily Record Runtime Path

## Decision

`DailyRecord` must resolve through one canonical path:

`query or subscription -> repository facade -> persistence golden path -> local/remote reconciliation -> cache/UI`.

`null` is not a generic domain signal. Runtime must distinguish:

- `missing_confirmed`
- `missing_transient`
- `recoverable`
- `unavailable`

Realtime subscription, initial query, local recovery and sync telemetry must speak that same contract.

## Why

The most fragile boundary in the app is the intersection of TanStack Query cache, realtime Firestore, IndexedDB fallback and sync recovery. When each layer inferred “record missing” on its own, transient nulls could look like a genuinely missing day.

## Source Of Truth

- Public read/write/sync entrypoint: `src/services/repositories/DailyRecordRepository.ts`
- Read path and typed outcomes: `src/services/repositories/contracts/dailyRecordQueries.ts`
- Canonical local/remote precedence: `src/services/repositories/dailyRecordPersistenceGoldenPath.ts`
- Subscription and reconciliation: `src/services/repositories/dailyRecordRepositorySyncService.ts`
- Query/controller consumers:
  - `src/hooks/controllers/dailyRecordQueryController.ts`
  - `src/hooks/useDailyRecordQuery.ts`
  - `src/hooks/useDailyRecordSyncQuery.ts`

## Invariants

- UI must not decide by itself whether a day is really missing.
- Realtime `null` must not evict a valid local record unless repository reconciliation confirms absence.
- Recovery policy belongs in repository/query contracts, not duplicated across hooks and views.
- The “today empty state” is a last visible fallback, not the first interpretation of a transient remote miss.

## How To Change Safely

1. If the change affects read/sync semantics, update `dailyRecordQueries.ts` before changing UI consumers.
2. If the change affects precedence, update `dailyRecordPersistenceGoldenPath.ts` and `dailyRecordRepositorySyncService.ts` together.
3. If the visible empty-state behavior changes, update the controller/hook path before touching `CensusView.tsx`.
4. Any new runtime incident must emit operational telemetry and update the runbook/reporting path.

## Required Validation

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run check:quality`
- `npm run test:release-confidence`
- At least the suites covering:
  - `src/tests/services/repositories/dailyRecordRepositorySyncService.test.ts`
  - `src/tests/hooks/controllers/dailyRecordQueryController.test.ts`
  - `src/tests/hooks/useDailyRecordSyncQuery.test.tsx`
  - relevant census empty-state tests
